    Cell decoding function (only supported when batch is 1)

    Args:
        - heatmap: (batch, 2, height, width)
        - reg: Offset vector graph of the center point or corner point, (batch, 2, height, width)
        - ct2cn: Vector graph with corner point pointing to center point, (batch, 8, height, width)
        - cn2ct: Vector graph of center point pointing to corner point, (batch, 8, height, width)
        - center_k: The maximum number of center points
        - corner_k: The maximum number of corners
        - center_thresh: The center point threshold, if the center point score is less than this threshold, it will not participate in the subsequent calculation
        - corner_thresh: Corner threshold, if the corner score is less than this threshold, it will not be included in subsequent calculations
        - corners: Whether to return corner coordinates

    Returns:
        - cells: cell, (batch, center_k, 8), where center_k is the number of center points, and 8 is the xy coordinates of the four corners of the cell, i.e., top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right
        - cells_scores: Cell fractions, (batch, center_k, 1), where the scores are sorted from highest to lowest
        - cells_corner_count: The number of times the cell corners are optimized (batch, center_k, 2), where the last dimension has two times, the first is the number of optimized corners (up to 4), and the second is the number of repeats
        - logic_coords: Logical coordinates of the cell
